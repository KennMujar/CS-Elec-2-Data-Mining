ðŸ§  Detection and Analysis of Suicidal and Depression Tendencies through Textual Data using BERT
This project focuses on the detection and analysis of suicidal and depressive tendencies in individuals by mining insights from textual data. We utilize BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to understand and classify mental health indicators in text, aiming to support early intervention efforts through AI-driven analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives:
Identify linguistic patterns associated with suicidal ideation and depression

Leverage BERTâ€™s deep contextual understanding of language

Build a classification model for early detection from social media posts
